Token : 
-------
Token is the smallest unit of information.
Token includes : 
    a. Constant
    b. Variable 
    c. Keyword 
    d. Identifiers
    e. Seperators 
    f. Operators

a. Constant : Constant is an entity, whose value cannot be changed during the execution of program.
Here we use const keyword to define constant.

Constant can be classified as : 
    i. Number (Integer | Real) constant
    ii.Character | String Constant 

b. Variable : Variable is the name given to a memory location, whose value may change during the execution of program. 
   Here we represent variable by var and let.
   
   Types of variables : 
    i. Local variable 
    ii. Global Variable 
    iii. Instance Variable 
    iv. Static Variable 

c. Keywords : Keywords are the reserved words, whose meaning is already defined. we cannot use keywords as a variable name.
There are approximately 63 keywords in javascript.
Ex : for, let, var, const, default, case, switch etc

d. Identifiers : Userdefined names 
   Variable : lowercase 
   Constant : uppercase 
   function : Camelcase 
   class : Pascal case

   cases : 
    Camel case : addProduct, addProductCategory etc
    Pascal Case : Demo 
    Snake case : add_product, add_product_details etc
    Habib case : add-product, add-product-details

e. Sepeartor : 
    , comma
    ; semi-colon
    {} curly brackets 
    () Parenthesis
    [] Square brackets

f. Operators : Operators are the symbols, which are used to perform some operations on one or more than one operand(variable and constant).

x + y, 5 + 6, x + 6;

Types of Operators : 
    1. Assignment operator (=)
    2. Arithmetic operator (+,-,*,/,%)
    3. Relational operator (>,<,<=,>=,!=,==,===,!==)
    4. Compound operator | Shorthand operator | Arithmetic assignment operator (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
    5. Conditional | Ternary operator (?:)
    6. Logical operator 
        -- logical and (&&)
        -- logical or (||)
        -- logical not (!)
    7. Bitwise Operator 
        -- Bitwise and (&)
        -- Bitwise or (|)
        -- Bitwise xor (^)
        -- leftshift (<<)
        -- rightshift (>>)
        -- complement (~)
    8. Increment | Decrement operator (++ --)
    9. Misc operator 
        . dot operator 
        typeof operator 
        exponential operator etc
